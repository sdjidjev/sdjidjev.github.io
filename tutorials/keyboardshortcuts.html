	    	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best programmers who pump out all that glorious code at hackathons or finish up that CS project that's due in 15 minutes usually have a system which they've optimized in order to be as efficient as possible. One trait that I've noticed between some of the most elite programmers is the fact that they are constantly at the keyboard. Constantly, meaning that when they're in the zone, precious time lost by, say, stopping to reach for the mouse, is time which could have been better spent programming. This is why I am dedicated to trying to maximize my keyboard usage and minimize mouse usage as much as possible. I have included my collection of these tips and tricks below for the purposes of having a reference for myself as well as to help shape a new generation of turbo-productive programmers. <br><br>
