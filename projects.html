	    		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;geo.ly is a website where if you can't find your friends, just go to the website, click on "Create," send the generated link to your friend, and then you can see the location of you and your friend in real time! There is a compass which shows you in which direction your friend is. I worked on this with <a href = "http://www.dchunwong.com" class = "textlink"> Dylan Chun Wong</a> and <a href = "http://www.melaniecebula.com"class = "textlink">Melanie Cebula</a> at the <a href = "https://www.hacksy.com/BigHack" class = "textlink">Big Hack</a> on April 2013. It currently works only for iPhone, so we are working on making it available to most mobile platforms. We're also working on making it available publicly (i.e. it runs only on localhost now). geo.ly uses node.js, HTML5, CSS, Google Maps API, Python's SimpleHTTPServer, PhoneGap, and Webkit.<br><br>

We're currently in the process of adding a rating feature. Rate My Cat uses HTML5, CSS, MongoDB, and Flask.<br><br>

	    		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a <a href="http://challenge.nm.org" class = "textlink">Supercomputing Challenge</a> project that I worked on my senior year of high school. My team (Alexandra Porter and Lauren Li) and I developed an algorithm which uses characteristics of both the Power Iteration and Ant Colony optimzation techniques in order to find communities in networks with maximum modularity. This novel algorithm proved to run faster and with more accuracy than traditionally used algorithms for most cases. The algorithms and the visualization were coded in Java.<br><br>
