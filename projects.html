	    		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geo.ly is a website where if you can't find your friends, click on "Create," send the generated link to your friend, and then you can see the location of you and your friend in real time! There is a compass which shows you in which direction your friend is. I worked on this with <a href = "http://www.dchunwong.com" class = "textlink" target="_blank"> Dylan Chun Wong</a> and <a href = "http://www.melaniecebula.com" class = "textlink" target="_blank">Melanie Cebula</a> at the <a href = "https://www.hacksy.com/BigHack" class = "textlink" target="_blank">Big Hack</a> on April 2013. It currently works only for iPhone, so we are working on making it available to most mobile platforms. We're also working on making it available publicly (i.e. it runs only on localhost now). geo.ly uses node.js, HTML5, CSS, Google Maps API, Python's SimpleHTTPServer, PhoneGap, and Webkit.<br><br>

I worked on this with <a href = "http://www.dchunwong.com" class = "textlink"> Dylan Chun Wong</a> and <a href = "http://www.melaniecebula.com"class = "textlink">Melanie Cebula</a> at HackJam2 on February 2013. We're currently in the process of adding a rating feature. Rate My Cat uses HTML5, CSS, MongoDB, and Flask.<br><br>

	    		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a <a href="http://challenge.nm.org" class = "textlink">Supercomputing Challenge</a> project that I worked on my senior year of high school. My team (Alexandra Porter and Lauren Li) and I developed an algorithm which uses characteristics of both the Power Iteration and Ant Colony optimzation techniques in order to find communities in networks with maximum modularity. This novel algorithm proved to run faster and with more accuracy than traditionally used algorithms for most cases. This project won 3rd place in the Supercomputing Challenge. The algorithms and the visualization were coded in Java.<br><br>

	    		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a <a href="http://challenge.nm.org" class = "textlink">Supercomputing Challenge</a> project that I worked on my junior year of high school. My team (Peter Ahrens and Dustin Tauxe) and I analyzed the performance of different implementations of Ant Colony Optimizations as applied to the Travelling Salesman Problem. Ant Colony Optimziations are interesting because they use real life ant behavior in order to find a very good solution to the problem in a small amount of time. Read our <a href = "http://challenge.nm.org/archive/10-11/finalreports/56.pdf" class = "textlink">report</a> for more information. This project won 2nd place in the Supercomputing Challenge. Python was used for the algorithm and the visualization. <br><br>

	    		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a <a href="http://challenge.nm.org" class = "textlink" target="_blank">Supercomputing Challenge</a> project that I worked on my sophomore year of high school. My team (Peter Ahrens, Mei Liu, and Victoria Wang) and I analyzed the performance of different parameter search techniques on how they optimize the parameters of a flocking model. This project won 3rd place in the Supercomputing Challenge. NetLogo was used for the algorithm and the visualization.
