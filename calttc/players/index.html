									&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver He is a sophomore pursuing a joint degree in math and CS. Heâ€™s from Minnesota (yes, apparently they play table tennis over there).  He practices at TTMN in Minnesota.  His current USATT rating is 1834 (though a bit underrated :P). He uses long pimples on the backhand and inverted on the forehand.  He usually plays close to the table with long pips (being too lazy to move his feet) but he can play a versatile game when called upon.  He directs the weekly round robins on Saturday for the club and does coaching for beginning to intermediate level players.  He loves playing and is still looking to improve.  Also, he is an expert in the art of trolling Jasmine Nguyen.  Please consult him if you ever need revenge on Jasmine.
